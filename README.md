# Nt_Poker

A free, open-source RedM script for poker.
** Still a work in progress **

## Dependencies
- RSG Core or VORP
- Ox_lib

## Features
- "Texas Hold 'Em" style poker
- Support for all possible win scenarios, with an advanced tie-breaker
- Configurable (tables, chairs, buttons, audio, animations)
- Added Features
    - Updated parts of the UI
    - added props to table, aesthetic only.
    - Ante controls raise increments and max raise amount.
    - Randomized seats
    - Auto next hand after a few seconds, with shifting who goes first.
    - Players can join while game is in progress
    - Verifies player funds and takes appropriate actions
    - Money is deducted from player as they bet.
- NPC Players
    - Code is very basic right now, will expand on it later.
    - 1 player is prop host, they will spawn in table props and npcs. If they leave a new prop host is assigned.
    - NPC's are played by the server.


## To DO
-NPC AI
    - NPC AI is very basic right now, will expand later.
- Bug fixing
    - Still need to fix some bugs, need more player vs player testing.

## Special Notes
- I could not figure out how to change the faces on the cards that the players hold.
